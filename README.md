# My Digital Environment - Alerts

## Introduction

**My Digital Environment - Alerts** is a Symfony Bundle provided by OpenEdition, extending and adding to the
functionalities of the **My Digital Environment** Bundle. It allows users to set alerts and receive notification when
new works are published on [OpenEdition Search](https://search.openedition.org).

This Bundle is developed as part of the COMMONS project (https://www.cnrs.fr/en/node/6271) supported by the CNRS and
three leading French infrastructures in the humanities and social sciences: OpenEdition, Huma-Num, and Métopes. It aims
to cover the entire knowledge production chain, from data creation to its dissemination in the public sphere.
